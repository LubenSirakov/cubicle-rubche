# cubicle-rubche

A SoftUni workshop with MongoDb, Mongoose, Express and Handlebars

"Cubicle" is a place, where you can browse some of the most popular rubik cubes in the world and add some new cubes that you have discovered. This application was created as an exercise for the JS BACK-END COURSE at the SOFTWARE UNIVERSITY.
